                 <p>Hi guys! I think that by now you know that we LOVE Halloween, and like every year, October is the perfect season for spooky readings (well, never is bad season for spooky readings, but you know what we meant). This year we thought about Laura Purcell and her famous book The Silent Companions. We are not gonna go too much into detail but you will see why we love this book. As always, we look forward for your comments & feeback about this one or others that you might be rading now. Lets go, witches!<strong>#Bookstagram</strong><strong>#Spookyoctober</strong></p>

                 <p>Well, well, I dont know if you will be suprised by this choice, Dracula or Frankstein are quite te picks for such a month. We did choose this one with one thing in mind: telling about this other book, <strong>Carmilla</strong>, the first  sapphic-vampires in literature. Hope that you hop into this tow with the same excitament are we were chosing them. <strong>#Bookstagram</strong><strong>#Spookyoctober</strong></p>
